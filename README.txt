This is my GitHub reprository for Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++ exercises I solved. I included the exercises I didn't solve in the corresponding chapters .txt file. I have solved some exercises that I didn't include here, but I didn't include them just because I thought they were trivial (for example, changing the contents of a string that is displayed on the screen). 

"Main" code for exercises from Chapter 13 to Chapter 15 are in folder Headers, file named "Chapter_13-15.h". The files in the folders from these chapters are just files that demonstrate some of the classes defined in the aforementioned header.

Note that in order to run the exercises for Chapters 12-16, you will have to set up FLTK. A nice guide was written here: https://bewuethr.github.io/installing-fltk-133-under-visual-studio/ Note also that this same user has a reprository for the code from this same book, so feel free to check that out too.

If some exercise isn't included in the "Unsolved exercises" section of the chapter notes, that is because that exercise is most likely a question and not a task to write code for.

Feel free to give me feedback!
