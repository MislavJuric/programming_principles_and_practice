13. Modify the Link class from §17.10.1 to hold a value of a struct God. struct God should have members of type string: name, mythology, vehicle, and weapon. For example, God{'Zeus', 'Greek', '', 'lightning'} and God{'Odin', 'Norse', 'Eight-legged flying horse called Sleipner', 'Spear called Gungnir'}. Write a print_all() function that lists gods with their attributes one per line. Add a member function add_ordered() that places its new element in its correct lexicographical position. Using the Links with the values of type God, make a list of gods from three mythologies; then move the elements (gods) from that list to three lexicographically ordered lists — one for each mythology.

14. Could the “list of gods” example from §17.10.1 have been written using a singly-linked list; that is, could we have left the prev member out of Link? Why might we want to do that? For what kind of examples would it make sense to use a singly-linked list? Re-implement that example using only a singly-linked list.
