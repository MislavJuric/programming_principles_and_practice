Notes:

I remember having solved a fair amount of exercises in Chapter 12, but I can't find the code... You'll notice that Chapters 13-15 also deal with graphics, so I urge you to look into them too.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Unsolved exercises:

3. Draw your initials 150 pixels high. Use a thick line. Draw each initial in a different color.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Draw a 3-by-3 tic-tac-toe board of alternating white and red squares.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Draw a red 1-inch frame around a rectangle that is three-quarters the height of your screen and two-thirds the width.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. What happens when you draw a Shape that doesn’t fit inside its window? What happens when you draw a Window that doesn’t fit on your screen? Write two programs that illustrate these two phenomena.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

7. Draw a two-dimensional house seen from the front, the way a child would: with a door, two windows, and a roof with a chimney. Feel free to add details; maybe have “smoke” come out of the chimney.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

8. Draw the Olympic five rings. If you can’t remember the colors, look them up.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

9. Display an image on the screen, e.g., a photo of a friend. Label the image both with a title on the window and with a caption in the window.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

10. Draw the file diagram from §12.8.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

11. Draw a series of regular polygons, one inside the other. The innermost should be an equilateral triangle, enclosed by a square, enclosed by a pentagon, etc. For the mathematically adept only: let all the points of each N-polygon touch sides of the (N+1)-polygon. Hint: The trigonometric functions are found in <cmath> (§24.8, §B.9.2).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

12. A superellipse is a two-dimensional shape defined by the equation

<ellipse equation here>

Look up superellipse on the web to get a better idea of what such shapes look like. Write a program that draws “starlike” patterns by connecting points on a superellipse. Take a, b, m, n, and N as arguments. Select N points on the superellipse defined by a, b, m, and n. Make the points equally spaced for some definition of “equal.” Connect each of those N points to one or more other points (if you like you can make the number of points to which to connect a point another argument or just use N–1, i.e., all the other points).

13. Find a way to add color to the lines from the previous exercise. Make some lines one color and other lines another color or other colors.
