Unsolved exercises:

6. Make an “analog clock,” that is, a clock with hands that move. You get the time of day from the operating system through a library call. A major part of this exercise is to find the functions that give you the time of day and a way of waiting for a short period of time (e.g., a second for a clock tick) and to learn to use them based on the documentation you found. Hint: clock(), sleep().
