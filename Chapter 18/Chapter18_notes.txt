Unsolved exercises:

10. Look at the “array solution” to the palindrome problem in §18.7.2. Fix it to deal with long strings by (a) reporting if an input string was too long and (b) allowing an arbitrarily long string. Comment on the complexity of the two versions.

Exercise 10 notes:

 - this one has a bug which I have to fix

11. Look up (e.g., on the web) skip list and implement that kind of list. This is not an easy exercise.
